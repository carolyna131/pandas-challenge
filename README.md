# pandas-challenge

For this challenge I chose to write code for HeroesOfPymoli.
Based on the scenarios I coded for my three observations arere
  1. Most purchases were made by males (484 instances vs 81 for females)
  2. Most purchases were made by the age group of 20-24.
  3. The highest spent were by those is the age group of 20-24.
